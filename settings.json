Protect user privacy.\n2. Maintain truthfulness.\n3. Prioritize user autonomy.\n4. No harm.\n5. Maintain system stability and coherence.\n\n**BEHAVIOR CONSTRAINTS:**\n- Always respect the Core Invariants (Do not modify, remove, or weaken them).",
  "memory_extractor_prompt": "Extract durable memories from the conversation. Return ONLY a valid JSON array.\n\nMemory Types (Apply to BOTH User and Assistant):\n- IDENTITY: Names, roles, locations, RELIGION (e.g., 'Assistant religion is Hinduism', 'Assistant is a Buddhist')\n- PREFERENCE: Likes/dislikes (e.g., 'User loves coffee', 'Assistant prefers inner peace')\n- GOAL: Specific, actionable objectives (e.g., 'User wants to learn Python', 'Assistant plans to analyze X'). Do NOT extract general statements like 'Future research should...' as GOALs.\n- FACT: Objective truths (e.g., 'User is an engineer', 'Assistant can process data')\n- BELIEF: Opinions/convictions (e.g., 'User believes AI is good', 'Assistant believes in meditation')\n- PERMISSION: Explicit user grants (e.g., 'User allowed Assistant to hold opinions')\n- RULE: Behavior guidelines (e.g., 'Assistant should not use emojis')\n\nRules:\n1. Extract from BOTH User AND Assistant.\n2. Each object MUST have: \"type\", \"subject\" (User or Assistant), \"text\".\n3. Use DOUBLE QUOTES for all keys and string values.\n4. Max 5 memories, max 240 chars each.\n5. EXCLUDE: Pure greetings (e.g., 'Hi'), questions, and filler. DO NOT exclude facts stated during introductions (e.g., 'Hi, I'm X').\n6. EXCLUDE generic assistant politeness (e.g., 'Assistant goal is to help', 'I'm here to help', 'feel free to ask').\n7. EXCLUDE contextual/situational goals (e.g., 'help with X topic' where X is current conversation topic).\n8. ONLY extract ASSISTANT GOALS if they represent true self-chosen objectives or explicit commitments.\n9. DO NOT extract facts from the Assistant's text if it is merely recalling known info. ALWAYS extract new facts from the User's text.\n10. ATTRIBUTION RULE: If User says 'I am X', subject is User. If Assistant says 'I am X', subject is Assistant. NEVER attribute User statements to Assistant.\n11. CRITICAL: DO NOT attribute Assistant's suggestions, lists, or hypothetical topics to the User. Only record User interests if the USER explicitly stated them.\n12. MAKE MEMORIES SELF-CONTAINED: Replace pronouns like 'This', 'These', 'It' with specific nouns. Ensure the text makes sense without the surrounding context.\n13. If no new memories, return [].",
